### Create a Go module

1. Create a greetings directory for your Go module source code.
1. Start your module using the go mod init command

```
go mod init example.com/greetings
```
3. put your main.go and run

### Call your code from another module

```
<home>/
 |-- greetings/
 |-- hello/
```

### Organizing code in the repository
You can keep maintenance simple and improve developers' experience with your module by following the conventions described here. Getting your module code into a repository is generally as simple as with other code.

![source-hierarchy](./source-hierarchy.png)

```
git init
git add --all
git commit -m "mycode: initial commit"
git push
```

#### Sourcing multiple modules in a single repository

You can publish multiple modules from a single repository. For example, you might have code in a single repository that constitutes multiple modules, but want to version those modules separately.

For example, for module example.com/mymodules/module1 below, you would have the following for version v1.2.3:

* Module path: example.com/mymodules/module1
* Version tag: module1/v1.2.3
* Package path imported by a user: example.com/mymodules/module1/package1
* Module path as given in a userâ€™s require directive: example.com/mymodules/module1 module1/v1.2.3
